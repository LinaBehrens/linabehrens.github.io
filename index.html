		<p> 
		Once upon a time, there was a Bee Queendom, centred on a buzzing bee hive. It used to be the largest and strongest bee hive known to Bee-kind for many moons. During that time, the Queendom had fought many battles, particularly with the neighbouring ants and beetles.
		</p>
		<p> 
		One day, the Head of Beetles and Queen of Ants decided that they much rather built anthills and beetle dung balls than fighting one battle after another. Thus, they created the 'crawling-union' – in short CU. The bees initially remained sceptical of the union as they had strong links to other creepy crawlies. But as they saw more and more ants and beetles collaborating, they decided to opt in – but remained hesitant.
		</p>
		<p> 
		A few moons passed, and the union flourished. There had been no more wars since the creation of the CU and the former enemies fostered trade and exchange between each other. Yet, the bees remained hesitant and preferred a very lose form of cooperation, mainly focused on trading honeycomb and dung balls. The Queen Bee often asked for exceptions. The ants and beetles were surprised ever so often about the Queen Bee's requests for special treatment, but most often agreed with them to keep the peace.
		</p>
		<p> 
		Over time, ants, beetles and bees started mixing, so that the borders between each territory became less rigid. Many ants and beetles decided to move into the bee hive to be part of the buzz and try their luck – and many bees went to settle in the neighbouring ant hill. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		As you know, ants are very hard working and thus grew successful, even though they often worked in the darkest cells where the hive's honey comb production was located. Contrary to most ants, beetles tended to work closely to the centre of the buzz, mainly to carry and select the best honey comb. Bees preferred beetles in these important roles, even though ants were as good at it or even better.
		</p>
		<p> 
		One of the beetles moving to the bee Queendom was little beetle Betty. She initially moved over to study at one of the fabulous bee schools, and fell in love with the buzziness of the bee hive. Following her studies, she found work close to the centre of the buzz. Over the coming moons, she became close friends with many bees, ants and other beetles living in the hive. Betty thought that she was the luckiest beetle in the world!
		</p>
		<p> 
		But one day all of this started to change. Several of the largest news leafs such as The Moon started talking about the large influx of ants and other non-bee crawlies, following the creation of the CU.
		</p>
		<p> 
		As you might imagine, some bees didn't take this new development very well. They started asking for additional checks at the entrance to the bee hive and made public requests to limit the number of non-bee workers. Beetles, ants and many bees ignored these new buzzes, but they grew louder and louder and louder. So loud in fact, that the Queen Bee decided to let all bees come together to sign their beeswax in a waxerendum.
		</p>
		<p> 
		As the day of the waxerendum came closer, little Betty started to get scared. On the news buzzer she had listen to so many bees, day after day, arguing to close the hive doors, whilst on the news leafs she read about all the advantages for bees being able to carefully select whom to let into the hive.
		</p>
		<p> 
		For Betty, even raising these questions came out of the blue. Hadn't the CU prevented numerous disputes across bees, ants and beetles following long moons of fierce battles? Wasn't it a good thing to have such a crawling-flying exchange as could be seen in the bee hive and many other places in the CU?
		</p>
		<p> 
		A few days before the waxerendum, Betty had a discussion with one of her bee friends. She revealed her secret: she was thinking of leaving the bee hive, even though it had grown her home, if the bees decided to leave the CU. Her friend was shocked - 'but it's not you they are talking about, it's the ants!'. Betty couldn't believe it, weren't they all the same, fellow CU crawlies?
		</p>
		<p> 
		Then the day came.
		</p>
		<p> 
		Betty and her friends - ants, bees and beetles - all watched the results coming in together. Everyone was tense and nervous. The time seemed to stand still.
		</p>
		<p> 
		'And the count of the waxes says.... --------- .....close the bee hive doors!'
		</p>
		<p> 
		The little beetle couldn't say a word. A small tear formed and started rolling across her cheek. The world seemed to stand still for a moment.
		</p>
		<p> 
		And then the chaos started. Nobody had thought that this would actually happen. The bee hive doors were temporarily closed to await new orders. The leaders of the beetles and the ants, as well as the Queen Bee issued statement after statement. Nobody knew what would happen.
		</p>
		<p> 
		In midst of the mess, the little beetle Betty started packing her belongings. She went to say goodbye to her fellow colleagues and friends, bees, ants and beetles, and many other crawlies she had gotten to know in her beloved bee hive that she used to call home. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		As she waited with many other ants and beetles who had also decided to leave the bee hive, their home where they weren’t wanted anymore, a Twittering leaf came in: 
		</p>
		<p class="twittering"> 
		'Queen Bee shocked by ant and beetle exodus. 
		<br> Shortage of workers in honeycomb production. 
		<br> Negotiation started with the CU. 
		<br> Bee hive doors remain closed - to prevent ants and beetles from LEAVING'.
		</p>
